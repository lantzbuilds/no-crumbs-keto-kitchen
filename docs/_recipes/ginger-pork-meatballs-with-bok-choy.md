ingredients:
  - "14 oz ground pork"
  - "3 oz radishes"
  - "10 oz baby bok choy"
  - "1-inch piece fresh ginger"
  - "1 Tbsp rice vinegar"
  - "¼ cup sugar-free barbecue sauce"
  - "2 Tbsp soy glaze (or coconut aminos as keto alt)"
  - "¼ cup panko breadcrumbs (optional, or use crushed pork rinds for keto version)"
  - "1 Tbsp olive oil"
  - "2 Tbsp water"

instructions:
  - Wash and dry the fresh produce. Thinly slice the radishes and place in a bowl with the rice vinegar. Season with salt and pepper and let marinate for at least 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - Peel and finely chop the ginger. Cut off and discard the root ends of the bok choy. Separate stems and leaves; roughly chop both.
  - In a bowl, mix barbecue sauce, soy glaze, and water to create a glaze.
  - In a large bowl, combine pork, breadcrumbs (or pork rinds), and chopped ginger. Season with salt and pepper. Form into 10 tightly packed meatballs.
  - Heat olive oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add meatballs and cook for 7–9 minutes, turning occasionally, until browned on all sides. Move to one side of the pan.
  - Add bok choy stems to the other side of the pan. Season and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - Add the glaze to the pan, spooning it over the meatballs. Cook for 1–2 minutes more, until meatballs are cooked through and the glaze is slightly thickened.
  - Turn off the heat and stir in bok choy leaves until wilted and combined.
  - Plate with marinated radishes on the side, including any vinegar from the bowl. Enjoy!

These ginger-spiced pork meatballs are paired with sautéed bok choy and punchy marinated radishes. We’ve omitted the rice to keep this dish keto-friendly and recommend sugar-free barbecue sauce and pork rinds in place of breadcrumbs for a fully low-carb meal.
